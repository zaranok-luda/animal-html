			<p>Polar bears are stocky, with a long neck, relatively small head, short, rounded ears, and a short tail. The male, which is much larger than the female, weighs 410 to 720 kg (900 to 1,600 pounds). It grows to about 1.6 metres (5.3 feet) tall at the shoulder and 2.2â€“2.5 metres in length.Strong, sharp claws are also important for gaining traction, for digging through ice, and for killing prey. </p>
